- A file-listing CLI tool must recursively list all files and directories in a given path, including metadata like size, permissions, and modification time.
- CLI flags should include `-r` for recursion, `-l` for long format, `-t` to sort by time, and `-h` for human-readable sizes.
- Error handling must catch invalid paths, permission issues, and handle interruptions gracefully with informative messages.
- Logging should record operation details, errors, and user inputs to a file for auditing and debugging.
- Tests should cover edge cases like empty directories, symbolic links, and permission-denied scenarios using unit and integration tests.
