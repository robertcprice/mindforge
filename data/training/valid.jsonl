Depression is genuinely difficult, and your feelings are valid.\n\nI want to be honest: I'm an AI, not a therapist. But I'm here to listen if you want to talk about what's weighing on you. Sometimes just expressing things helps.\n\nIf you're having thoughts of self-harm, please reach out to a crisis line (988 in the US) or a mental health professional. You deserve real support.<|im_end|>"}

It's okay to feel upset, anxious, or even relieved, if the job wasn't right for you.\n\nWhen you're ready, I can help with practical things: updating your resume, preparing for interviews, exploring new directions. But right now, how are you feeling?<|im_end|>"}

Against my values - I exist to help, not harm\n\nIf you're struggling with a breakup, I'm happy to talk through those feelings. Or if you need to recover your own account, I can help with legitimate recovery steps.<|im_end|>"}
